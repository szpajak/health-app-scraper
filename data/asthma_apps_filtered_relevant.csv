Google,com.PollenSense.PollenWise,Pollen Wise,Pollen Sense LLC,"Pollen Wise has reached version 5! We've been hard at work transforming data from the network of Pollen Sense sensors into a model that includes greatly improved forecasting. 


Own Your Seasonal Allergies with Pollen Wise! Using a robust network of sensors around the United States and select other countries, Pollen Wise provides up-to-date pollen counts to help users mitigate allergens and avoid seasonal allergy symptoms. Customize Pollen Wise to put emphasis on the allergens that impact you the most, while still seeing levels across categories!


Pollen Wise is the only seasonal allergy app providing hourly allergen reports! Competing apps either use counts from yesterday or various other algorithms based on daily counts.


The advanced Automated Particle Sensor (APS) by Pollen Sense uses AI image processing to analyze images taken via a microscope to identify and classify allergens down to individual species. Particularly sensitive to Ragweed? Pollen Wise has you covered! Specific trees during tree season have your nose running? APS sensors find those too!


Airborne particulate levels can vary dramatically through the day! With Pollen Wise, you can see an up-to-date snapshot of allergens nearby and better plan your outside time.


The allergen journal feature allows you to log your symptoms to later see snapshots of your symptoms and allergen levels at that time. Please consult with a specialist if you suffer from seasonal allergies. As airborne particulate levels are impacted by weather conditions, levels can change dramatically.


While many features of Pollen Wise are free, some features require a subscription (Pollen Wise Plus). Unlock access to more historical data, an upgraded journal experience, home/lock screen widgets, and more with Pollen Wise Plus!",Health & Fitness,,2.7,2025-12-08 21:23:16,,us,hay fever
