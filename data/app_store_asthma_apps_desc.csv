It affects your sleep, focus, energy, and daily routines. You may deal with wheezing, coughing, chest tightness, or shortness of breath with no clear warning. Some days are fine. Other days feel like you are trying to breathe through a straw. This app is built to help you take control.

This asthma tracker helps you monitor symptoms, medication use, triggers, and peak flow readings in one easy-to-use system. Whether you have mild asthma or are managing frequent flare-ups, this app gives you the clarity and consistency needed to manage your condition with more confidence.

SYMPTOM TRACKING  
Log daily symptoms like chest tightness, shortness of breath, coughing, wheezing, and fatigue. Track morning and evening separately if needed. Record symptom severity, duration, and frequency so you can see how your condition changes over time.

INHALER AND MEDICATION REMINDERS  
Set reminders for controller medications, rescue inhalers, steroids, or other asthma treatments. Stay consistent with timing and dosage. Log each use and mark if taken early, on time, or missed. Refill reminders help prevent running out at the wrong moment.

PEAK FLOW AND LUNG MONITORING  
Track your peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) over time using a manual input or connected device. Record daily readings, track variability, and flag low zones. Over time, spot when your lung function is declining and respond before a full flare-up begins.

IDENTIFY TRIGGERS  
Log known or suspected triggers like dust, pollen, smoke, mold, exercise, stress, cold air, or illness. Track environmental data or weather patterns that may affect your breathing. Use custom notes to describe where symptoms occurred and what may have caused them.

SEE WHAT’S WORKING  
Compare medication use and peak flow with symptom trends. Use visual charts to understand how well your current plan is working. Share this data with your doctor, nurse, or care team to make more informed decisions together.

APPLE HEALTH INTEGRATION  
Sync sleep, step count, heart rate, and other data from Apple Health to understand how asthma is affecting your overall wellbeing. Review how flare-ups relate to sleep loss or stress to help reduce future risk.

PREP FOR YOUR NEXT APPOINTMENT

Having a chronic condition like COPD, depression or bipolar disorder means constantly worrying about getting into an episode again. There are plenty of triggers for that and often it is not clear, whether it is your sleep, your activity/workout or the weather that drives your wellbeing. Your physician probably told you to keep a journal but monitoring all that is more work that anyone would want to invest. 

Actually there is no need to: your smartphone, your apple watch, your step counter, or any other smartwatch, they all do this work for you. juli combines all this data to give you the relevant health information at your fingertips: from monitoring your activity, heart rate or sleep, adding external data like sunshine, pollen or air pollution. juli will also ask you daily a few quick questions about your condition related wellbeing. Questions like:
(For COPD) Did you have to use your inhaler yesterday or did you wake up due to an episode of shortness of breath?
(For depression) How are you today, how is your energy level 

All this data will allow you to find patterns and identify triggers that influence your COPD or depression. juli is the first start into a new you. 

juli’s functions in detail: 

TRACK YOUR WELLBEING: 
Gather health data collected on your smartphone or smartwatch: sleep, activity, workouts, heart rate, cycle, O2 saturation, period and much more
Get real time weather forecast, pollen and air pollution precisely for where your are
Track your daily situation: COPD episodes, mood, energy, medication intake - quick and easily with one touch

DISCOVER TRIGGERS
Visualize your situation on a daily basis, see trends and discover correlations between your wellbeing and other factors.
Take control of your health situation by identifying triggers for your COPD attacks or discovering what helps when you have a depressive episode.

GET REMINDERS
juli makes it easier to remember to take your medicine or use your inhaler, so you can worry less and live healthier. You can keep track of your medication intake and see what impact it has on your wellbeing as a person with COPD, depression or bipolar.

KEEP A JOURNAL
Have a full medical record at your fingertips and add to it personal notes about what is noteworthy. 

The juli founders suffer from various conditions like bipolar disorder themselves. They know exactly, how it is to be at the mercy of your COPD or depression. But they are electronic wizards and thought how to make use of Apple Health, weather data and more for their purpose. They came up with the idea of a health tracker or journal that minimizes the effort to monitor data related to COPD or depression and has a reminder functionality for medication. More chronic conditions are soon to come as well as recommendations and goal setting.

juli is all about you being the manager of your condition. You will find out how much exercise is good for your COPD, whether sunlight will help your depression or how much sleep is a warning signal for your bipolar disorder. Control is about finding out, what has an impact. With juli all your health data is conveniently kept in one place for you to find out.

In addition, you can add contextual information to each entry by either associating it with a pre-defined event (such as a doctor’s appointment) or with individual notes.

With the built-in reminder, you can set Asthma Tracker to remind you to take your daily base medication, to measure your peak flow and to record your symptoms. At the end of each month, it will also prompt you to complete the widely-known Asthma Control Test™ whose intent is to give you a rough idea as to how well controlled your asthma is.

The aggregated information in Asthma Tracker's chronological overview leverages the Health app to let you quickly asses how your asthma is progressing. Asthma Tracker stores and displays peak flow values stored in the Health app as well as puffs and symptoms alongside your daily step count. This way you can easily see how your daily activity influences your asthma and related symptoms.

Select individual days to get a more detailed view of each entry (peak flow, puffs or symptoms) on that particular day as well as the recorded step counts on that day.

Share your recorded asthma entries with your doctor during an appointment or take an in-depth look at it yourself on your desktop or other device with a bigger screen using the built-in integration with datalinker.io, our fully end-to-end encrypted solution for secure data transmission.

Blue inhalers save lives. Unless they are empty.
Long after the medication has run out, the propellant keeps puffing.
Smart Rescue will tell you when your blue rescue inhaler is running low or empty.
It will also show how many puffs you needed in the past 90 days. This will help you identify your triggers and help your prescriber optimise your medication.



Brown inhalers also save lives. But have you taken it? How do you know?
Smart Rescue sends reminders to take your medication morning and evening.
And tells you when you last used your inhaler.
You can share your inhaler records with your GP or parent/carer.
Better compliance with preventer medication reduces reliance on reliever inhalers, which is better for your health.

Having a chronic condition like COPD, depression or bipolar disorder means constantly worrying about getting into an episode again. There are plenty of triggers for that and often it is not clear, whether it is your sleep, your activity/workout or the weather that drives your wellbeing. Your physician probably told you to keep a journal but monitoring all that is more work that anyone would want to invest. 

Actually there is no need to: your smartphone, your apple watch, your step counter, or any other smartwatch, they all do this work for you. juli combines all this data to give you the relevant health information at your fingertips: from monitoring your activity, heart rate or sleep, adding external data like sunshine, pollen or air pollution. juli will also ask you daily a few quick questions about your condition related wellbeing. Questions like:
(For COPD) Did you have to use your inhaler yesterday or did you wake up due to an episode of shortness of breath?
(For depression) How are you today, how is your energy level 

All this data will allow you to find patterns and identify triggers that influence your COPD or depression. juli is the first start into a new you. 

juli’s functions in detail: 

TRACK YOUR WELLBEING: 
Gather health data collected on your smartphone or smartwatch: sleep, activity, workouts, heart rate, cycle, O2 saturation, period and much more
Get real time weather forecast, pollen and air pollution precisely for where your are
Track your daily situation: COPD episodes, mood, energy, medication intake - quick and easily with one touch

DISCOVER TRIGGERS
Visualize your situation on a daily basis, see trends and discover correlations between your wellbeing and other factors.
Take control of your health situation by identifying triggers for your COPD attacks or discovering what helps when you have a depressive episode.

GET REMINDERS
juli makes it easier to remember to take your medicine or use your inhaler, so you can worry less and live healthier. You can keep track of your medication intake and see what impact it has on your wellbeing as a person with COPD, depression or bipolar.

KEEP A JOURNAL
Have a full medical record at your fingertips and add to it personal notes about what is noteworthy. 

The juli founders suffer from various conditions like bipolar disorder themselves. They know exactly, how it is to be at the mercy of your COPD or depression. But they are electronic wizards and thought how to make use of Apple Health, weather data and more for their purpose. They came up with the idea of a health tracker or journal that minimizes the effort to monitor data related to COPD or depression and has a reminder functionality for medication. More chronic conditions are soon to come as well as recommendations and goal setting.

juli is all about you being the manager of your condition. You will find out how much exercise is good for your COPD, whether sunlight will help your depression or how much sleep is a warning signal for your bipolar disorder. Control is about finding out, what has an impact. With juli all your health data is conveniently kept in one place for you to find out. 


juli integrates with the Apple HealthKit API

Other days feel like you are trying to breathe through a straw. This app is built to help you take control.

This asthma tracker helps you monitor symptoms, medication use, triggers, and peak flow readings in one easy-to-use system. Whether you have mild asthma or are managing frequent flare-ups, this app gives you the clarity and consistency needed to manage your condition with more confidence.

SYMPTOM TRACKING

IDENTIFY TRIGGERS  
Log known or suspected triggers like dust, pollen, smoke, mold, exercise, stress, cold air, or illness. Track environmental data or weather patterns that may affect your breathing. Use custom notes to describe where symptoms occurred and what may have caused them.

SEE WHAT’S WORKING  
Compare medication use and peak flow with symptom trends. Use visual charts to understand how well your current plan is working. Share this data with your doctor, nurse, or care team to make more informed decisions together.

Perform flow rate calculations, calculate pressure drop in a pipe, size a pipe diameter, or calculate a maximum pipe length for a given flow rate at an allowed pressure loss.
 
The original Pipe Flow Wizard software is used by engineers in over 100 countries worldwide and now the new mobile version for iOS  brings the same calculations to iPhone and iPad. Find friction loss, find flow rate, find minimum size of pipe diameter for given flow rate and pressure loss, or find length of pipe for a specified maximum pressure loss.
 
Pipe Flow Wizard works for liquid and gas flow and allows for the inclusion of valves, fittings, and changes in elevation. Pressure losses for non-compressible fluids (liquids) are calculated using the Darcy-Weisbach formula, and for compressible fluids (gases), the user can choose from the General Fundamental Flow, Complete Isothermal Flow, AGA, IGT, Panhandle A, Panhandle B, or the Weymouth equation.  
 
Pipe Flow Wizard has databases for pipe materials, pipe diameters, pipe fittings (k factors), and fluids. Users can also specify and add their own data for pipe materials, sizes, fittings and fluids.  
 
Data and results can be entered and displayed in either imperial or metric units and the units of each individual field can be specified separately. 
 
Calculation results include Reynolds number, friction factor, flow type (laminar or turbulent), friction losses, fitting losses, fluid velocities and more.
 
Pipe Flow Wizard calculation results have been verified against 50 cases of published results from well known sources. These include calculated results for both liquid and gas systems. The results of these calculations are included in two Results Verification PDF documents which can be accessed from within the App. There is also a compressible gas flow equations document and a comprehensive user guide. 
 
The Pipe Flow Wizard App makes it easy for pipe system engineers to perform flow rate and pressure drop calculations, where the calculation results can easily be shared as an Excel or PDF Report. Calculations can also be saved to the iPhone or iPad and data files can be shared with other users of the software on either macOS or Windows.
 
The Pipe Flow Wizard software has unrivalled functions and features that aren't often found in other flow rate and pressure loss calculator apps:
 
- Liquid properties database for water, oils, acids, and other fluids.
- Gas properties database for air, nitrogen, natural gas, and other compressible fluids.
- Pipe material database for various Steel, Aluminium, Copper, HDPE, and other pipes.
- Fitting database for standard valves and bends, with associated K factor values.
- User definable custom materials, fluids and fittings.
- Gas properties calculator to help with the creation of user defined gas data at a specific temperature and pressure condition.
- Professional Excel and PDF reports showing calculation results. 
- Results verification against published data to provide confidence in the calculation results.
- Configurable post decimals for display on screen and in reports.
- Automatic conversion between a wide range of units.
- Compatibility with Pipe Flow Wizard files for macOS and Windows.
- High quality, reliable software, and unrivalled customer support.
 
Pipe Flow Software programs are trusted and used by engineers in over 100 countries worldwide.  
 
Pipe Flow Wizard offers auto-renewable subscriptions.  
Purchasing a subscription will remove all calculation restrictions and enable full use of the Pipe Flow Wizard App.
When a subscription expires, the App will return to Trial Mode, where certain calculations are restricted.

気候データはネットワークから自動取得されるため、入力の手間がかかりません。
レポート機能や蓄積したデータのエクスポート機能(CSVファイル)も備えています。

主な使い方はこちらの動画で紹介しています。
https://peakflow.apps.funyan.jp/PeakFlow.mp4

[機能]
1. データ記録と表示
以下のデータを入力可能です。

 - ピークフロー値と気候データ (1日に何回でも記録可、毎日決まった時刻に記録するとよいでしょう)
 - 日記 (症状やメモを1日1エントリ記録)

ピークフロー値と気候データ(気温/湿度/気圧)はグラフ表示で比較できます。喘息の症状と気候の変化との間になんらかの関連性があれば、このアプリで読み取ることができます。

2. 入力補助
気候データを入力する手間を省くための機能を備えています。

a. GPSをこのアプリで使用することを許可しており、ネットワークが繋がっている場合 =>「気温/湿度/気圧/天気」が自動入力されます
b. iPhone 6/iPhone 6 plus以降の気圧計を内蔵している機種の場合 =>「気圧」が自動入力されます

aとbの条件を両方満たしている場合は、内蔵気圧計のデータが優先されます。

aの自動入力はOpenWeatherMap(http://openweathermap.com/)のサービスを利用しています。GPSの位置情報から最寄りのステーションのデータを取得しますが、近くにOpenWeatherMapのステーションがない場合、少し離れた地点のステーションからデータを取得しますので、自動入力された気候データに誤差が生じる場合があります。天気等が明らかに違う場合は、必要に応じて修正をしてください。
何らかの理由により、OpenWeatherMapからの気象データ取得に失敗した場合には、気象庁のアメダスからのデータ取得を行います(日本国内のみ)。ただし、アメダスはOpenWeatherMapよりも観測地点が少ないため、OpenWeatherMapよりも現在地との誤差が大きくなる可能性があります。
気象データ取得元の情報は、ピークフロー入力フォームの一番下に表示されます。

3. 警告表示
特定の条件を満たした日の背景色を変え、症状が悪化した日をハイライト表示することができます。
警告表示をさせる条件は、以下の項目に対して設定可能です。

 - ピークフロー値の日中変動率
 - 喘息の症状
 - メモに記入したフリーキーワード

4. ピークフロー標準値の設定

ピークフロー計測値の客観的な分析にご利用いただけます。

 - 相関係数  => 気象データとピークフロー計測値との間の相関関係を数値であらわします
 - 平均値/最大値/最小値/計測回数

5b. サマリー
過去4週間 / 2週間 / 1週間の記録を要約して表示します。
通院時の医師への報告や、喘息コントロールテスト(ACT)実施時などにご利用いただけます。

5c. 全記録表示

Parts of this app may also be applied to a clinic or emergency room visit.

When a child is in the hospital, parents can be overwhelmed by nurses and doctors rushing around, speaking medical jargon. Sometimes health care providers think they are clearly communicating, but don’t check to make sure you understand their instructions. If you are able to teach back the information in your own words, you can be confident you do understand.

The Our JourneyTM with Asthma app is designed to:
— Be used from the time of admission throughout hospitalization, to facilitate conversations
between families and the health care team.
— Help parents identify what they need to know before going home.
— Give parents a safe way to admit what they don’t know or understand, and ask questions.
— Cue families on what they need to teach back to or demonstrate for their nurse or doctor.
This gives the health care provider an opportunity to confirm information and skills and correct misunderstandings.
— Help families feel confident that they can safely care for their child at home after discharge
from the hospital, know the signs of possible problems, and know how to respond.

About The Emily Center at Phoenix Children’s Hospital:
Founded in 1990, the Center is named after Emily Anderson. Emily fought a rare form of leukemia for four years before losing her battle a few days before her seventh birthday.
Frustrated by the lack of easy to understand information about Emily’s illness, her parents founded The Emily Center so that families of sick children would always have access to pediatric health information that is accurate, easy to understand, and free of charge to Arizona’s families. http://www.emilycenter.org and on Twitter @emilycenter

The Our JourneyTM with Asthma mobile app has been funded by a grant from Cox."

Parts of this app may also be applied to a clinic or emergency room visit.

When a child is in the hospital, parents can be overwhelmed by nurses and doctors rushing around, speaking medical jargon. Sometimes health care providers think they are clearly communicating, but don’t check to make sure you understand their instructions. If you are able to teach back the information in your own words, you can be confident you do understand.

The Our JourneyTM with Asthma app is designed to:
— Be used from the time of admission throughout hospitalization, to facilitate conversations
between families and the health care team.
— Help parents identify what they need to know before going home.
— Give parents a safe way to admit what they don’t know or understand, and ask questions.
— Cue families on what they need to teach back to or demonstrate for their nurse or doctor.
This gives the health care provider an opportunity to confirm information and skills and correct misunderstandings.
— Help families feel confident that they can safely care for their child at home after discharge
from the hospital, know the signs of possible problems, and know how to respond.

About The Emily Center at Phoenix Children’s Hospital:
Founded in 1990, the Center is named after Emily Anderson. Emily fought a rare form of leukemia for four years before losing her battle a few days before her seventh birthday.
Frustrated by the lack of easy to understand information about Emily’s illness, her parents founded The Emily Center so that families of sick children would always have access to pediatric health information that is accurate, easy to understand, and free of charge to Arizona’s families. http://www.emilycenter.org and on Twitter @emilycenter

The Our JourneyTM with Asthma mobile app has been funded by a grant from Cox."

Customize Pollen Wise to put emphasis on the allergens that impact you the most, while still seeing levels across categories!


Pollen Wise is the only seasonal allergy app providing hourly allergen reports! Competing apps either use counts from yesterday or various other algorithms based on daily counts.

Airborne particulate levels can vary dramatically through the day! With Pollen Wise, you can see an up-to-date snapshot of allergens nearby and better plan your outside time.

We've been hard at work transforming data from the network of Pollen Sense sensors into a model that includes greatly improved forecasting. 


Own Your Seasonal Allergies with Pollen Wise! Using a robust network of sensors around the United States and select other countries, Pollen Wise provides up-to-date pollen counts to help users mitigate allergens and avoid seasonal allergy symptoms. Customize Pollen Wise to put emphasis on the allergens that impact you the most, while still seeing levels across categories!


Pollen Wise is the only seasonal allergy app providing hourly allergen reports! Competing apps either use counts from yesterday or various other algorithms based on daily counts.


The advanced Automated Particle Sensor (APS) by Pollen Sense uses AI image processing to analyze images taken via a microscope to identify and classify allergens down to individual species. Particularly sensitive to Ragweed? Pollen Wise has you covered! Specific trees during tree season have your nose running? APS sensors find those too!


Airborne particulate levels can vary dramatically through the day! With Pollen Wise, you can see an up-to-date snapshot of allergens nearby and better plan your outside time.


The allergen journal feature allows you to log your symptoms to later see snapshots of your symptoms and allergen levels at that time. Please consult with a specialist if you suffer from seasonal allergies. As airborne particulate levels are impacted by weather conditions, levels can change dramatically.


While many features of Pollen Wise are free, some features require a subscription (Pollen Wise Plus). Unlock access to more historical data, an upgraded journal experience, home/lock screen widgets, and more with Pollen Wise Plus!"

asthma action plan,Our Journey with Asthma,969458324,"PHOENIX CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL, INC",Free,5,4,Medical,https://apps.apple.com/us/app/our-journey-with-asthma/id969458324?uo=4,"The Emily Center at Phoenix Children’s Hospital presents Our JourneyTM with Asthma as a tool to help families of children diagnosed with asthma identify what they need to know before taking their child home from the hospital. Parts of this app may also be applied to a clinic or emergency room visit.

When a child is in the hospital, parents can be overwhelmed by nurses and doctors rushing around, speaking medical jargon. Sometimes health care providers think they are clearly communicating, but don’t check to make sure you understand their instructions. If you are able to teach back the information in your own words, you can be confident you do understand.

The Our JourneyTM with Asthma app is designed to:
— Be used from the time of admission throughout hospitalization, to facilitate conversations
between families and the health care team.
— Help parents identify what they need to know before going home.
— Give parents a safe way to admit what they don’t know or understand, and ask questions.
— Cue families on what they need to teach back to or demonstrate for their nurse or doctor.
This gives the health care provider an opportunity to confirm information and skills and correct misunderstandings.
— Help families feel confident that they can safely care for their child at home after discharge
from the hospital, know the signs of possible problems, and know how to respond.

About The Emily Center at Phoenix Children’s Hospital:
Founded in 1990, the Center is named after Emily Anderson. Emily fought a rare form of leukemia for four years before losing her battle a few days before her seventh birthday.
Frustrated by the lack of easy to understand information about Emily’s illness, her parents founded The Emily Center so that families of sick children would always have access to pediatric health information that is accurate, easy to understand, and free of charge to Arizona’s families. http://www.emilycenter.org and on Twitter @emilycenter

The Our JourneyTM with Asthma mobile app has been funded by a grant from Cox."
