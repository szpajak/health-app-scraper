asthma,avatree,snousias,16,C++,https://github.com/snousias/avatree,"This paper presents AVATREE, a computational modelling framework that generates Anatomically Valid Airway tree conformations and provides capabilities for simulation of broncho-constriction apparent in obstructive pulmonary conditions. Such conformations are obtained from the personalized 3D geometry generated from computed tomography (CT) data through image segmentation. The patient-specific representation of the bronchial tree structure is extended beyond the visible airway generation depth using a knowledge-based technique built from morphometric studies. Additional functionalities of AVATREE include visualization of spatial probability maps for the airway generations projected on the CT imaging data, and visualization of the airway tree based on local structure properties. Furthermore, the proposed toolbox supports the simulation of broncho-constriction apparent in pulmonary diseases, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma. AVATREE is provided as an open-source toolbox in C++ and is supported by a graphical user interface integrating the modelling functionalities. It can be exploited in studies of gas flow, gas mixing, ventilation patterns and particle deposition in the pulmonary system, with the aim to improve clinical decision making."

There is a need to take preliminary measures to overcome this problem since it leads to many health related issues like asthma and heart problems. So, there is a need to predict the level of these toxicants during various times of the day in order to warn the people suffering from these diseases so that they can be more cautious during the critical intervals of the day. We have identified the major pollutants of the atmosphere as NO2 and O3 along with 11 other pollutants which are either meteorological or geographic and particulate concentrations. We have used the techniques for prediction such as Artificial Neural Networks(ANN) and ANFIS(Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference Systems) and compared them to find out that one perfect method that can precisely predict the concentrations for every 8 hours of the day."

Stress can place one at higher risk for diabetes, ulcers, asthma, migraine headaches, skin disorders, epilepsy, and sexual dysfunction In this project we try to go in the depth of this problem by trying to detect the stress patterns of people. we would like to apply image processing and machine learning techniques to analyze stress patterns and to narrow down the factors that strongly determine the stress levels. Machine Learning algorithms like CNN classifiers are applied to classify stress. Image Processing is used at the initial stage for detection, the person’s image is clicked by the camera which serves as input. By taking input as an image from video frames and output may be image or characteristics associated with that image.Real time face stress detection model. The model is image processing based model which is having two parts:Emotion Recognition,Stress level calculation The emotion recognition model will return the emotion predicted real time. The model classifies face as stressed and not stressed. A model is trained on the fer2013 dataset.The stress level is calculated with the help of eyebrows contraction and displacemnent from the mean position.

Away from the small measurement and noiseless functioning, it offers the capacity to take away dust, contaminants, fumes and airborne bacterias like Yeast infection, E-coli, Giardia, Salmonella, Cryptosporidium and Legionella.<br><br>Thus you've chosen to miss out my best selections (or not really, as the circumstance may become). Either approach, I don't head because it implies you're involved in obtaining out considerably more about oxygen purifiers, and what they perform.<br><br>The volumes detailed in the requirements of the cleaner perform certainly not translate beautifully into genuine life, integrating the dimension of the area for which the filter is suggested. Several elements take up a part in dimensions an oxygen cleaner all of which I've involved in this document.<br><br>Actually though nearly all weather cleaners today include HEPA filter, a great deal of them appear with pre-filters and/or stimulated cooking with charcoal briquettes (co2) filtration which substantially rise their blocking features. To locate out how they do the job and why they're a good have to possess, look at out my document on them.<br><br>While the cleaner's major task is definitely to filtration the oxygen inside your house, its efficiency and day-to-day individual knowledge can get increased by a variety of benefits and/or various bonuses. These might contain sensors, computerized modes, distant management and various other alternatives.<br><br>Since air flow purifiers are usually appropriate for treating a large array of impurities many of these as dirt, allergens, dust particles mites, canine dander and fur, bacteria, trojans, mildew and black mold spores, I possess considered a seem at how each of these debris are handled and after that eliminated from blood flow.<br><br>For those of you who endure from contact allergies and asthma (and I think your soreness), I've made a decision to reveal considerably more about the content and what you can carry out to aid decrease all that hacking and coughing, wheezing and sneezing!<br><br>I possess delivered the site you notice before you to the web not really because I'm in the company of air flow purifiers. In truth, it's very the other as I learn what it's like to put up with from many ailments induced by infected surroundings, as I experienced from hypersensitivity and regular asthma assaults. Hence, I chosen to discover a choice to my difficulty and it didn't acquire very long before I arrived across atmosphere purifiers. Considering the simply matter I got to perform was choose one, buy it, and my complications would get resolved, I quickly found out I seemed to be inappropriate.

The severity of the condition is variable.  Pneumonia is usually caused by infection with viruses or bacteria and less commonly by other microorganisms, certain medications or conditions such as autoimmune diseases. Risk factors include cystic fibrosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, diabetes, heart failure, a history of smoking, a poor ability to cough such as following a stroke and a weak immune system.Diagnosis is often based on the symptoms and physical examination. Chest X-ray, blood tests, and culture of the sputum may help confirm the diagnosis. The disease may be classified by where it was acquired, such as community- or hospital-acquired or health care-associated pneumonia.  Vaccines to prevent certain types of pneumonia are available. Other methods of prevention include hand washing and not smoking. Treatment depends on the underlying cause. Pneumonia believed to be due to bacteria is treated with antibiotics. If the pneumonia is severe, the affected person is generally hospitalized. Oxygen therapy may be used if oxygen levels are low.  Pneumonia affects approximately 450 million people globally (7% of the population) and results in about 4 million deaths per year. Pneumonia was regarded by Canadian pathologist William Osler in the 19th century as ""the captain of the men of death"". With the introduction of antibiotics and vaccines in the 20th century, survival greatly improved. Nevertheless, in developing countries, and also among the very old, the very young and the chronically ill, pneumonia remains a leading cause of death. Pneumonia often shortens suffering among those already close to death and has thus been called ""the old man's friend"".   ## AIM: * To classify the given X-Rays into Normal or Pnuemonia using CNN VGG-16 Architechture  ## Dataset: * https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia"

This system implements the combination of an android app, server, gas sensors (CO2, CO, LPG, and CH4) to sense the air quality of the environment and shows the real condition of air. Solving the draw backs of existing air quality sensors this device can be used to monitor various gasses at a time. The most demanding thing would be this system will give the real time data and will show the quality of the air based on the standard air quality. The system will give the user the indication of the air quality and based on given parameters it will let the user know how much the environmental air is polluted or safe. The goal is to make the system as reasonable as possible so that people from every society background can use this and if some research organization wants to do further research then if some nominal amount of money is invested then it would be a great solution to install a weather station thus air quality monitoring system."

asthma monitoring app,0-_Risk,Mirna-Navigator,0,,https://github.com/Mirna-Navigator/0-_Risk,"One of the most alarming issues in modern cities is the air quality level, where air pollution has caused 120 deaths out of 100,000 per year based on a worldwide study (Green Car Congress, 2019). The World Health Organization emphasized that 97% of cities in low- and middle- income countries with more than 100 000 inhabitants do not meet World Health Organization (WHO) air quality guidelines. Due to poor air quality, it will increase potential health risks such as risk of stroke, heart disease, lung cancer, asthma and others as well (citation). Hence, there is a need to install an air quality monitoring system in cities to ensure the air is not contaminated. This can be done by installing sensors to monitor dust particles, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide and sulfur dioxide levels and this information can be shared with the public through smartphones, where the smartphone app allows people to monitor real-time data of the current air quality level in the area. Hence, through these implementations, better quality of life can be achieved."
